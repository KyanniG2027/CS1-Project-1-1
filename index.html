  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>My family and I love eating and making Birria Tacos! Ever since I was a little girl we would make and eat them about twice a month, and they would be even more delicious everytime. Definetly one of my favorite mexican foods ever.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingrediants</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Tortias</li>
    <li>Oaxacan Cheese</li>
    <li>Dried chilles (guajillo, ancho and chiles de arbol)</li>
    <li>Mexican oregano</li>
    <li>Mexican cinnamon </li>
    <li>Short Rib, Stew Meat, Oaxtail</li>
    <li>Tomatoes, Onions, Garlic, Cilantro, Limes, Salt</li>
    

  </ul>
 
  <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Cuts of meat- Use stew meat and cut into big chunk around 3-inch pieces. And then for flavor you can add 1 pound of short ribs. You can use ALL chuck stew if you want. If there is any fatty excess pieces, just leave them because they add flavor to the sauce. You can also use 1 pound of oxtail in one testing of it and it was wonderful.</li>
      <li>Bring meat to room temperature and then salt it liberally.</li>
      <li>In a large pot that has an oven-proof lid, place it over medium-high heat. You‚Äôre probably going to have to do this in batches, but sear the meat on both sides for about 3 minutes per side. Transfer the meat to a bowl and then repeat with the remaining pieces of meat.</li>
      <li>Then add the chiles, tomatoes, onions, spices and garlic to a pot. Cover the chiles and everything with water and simmer for about 20 minutes. We want the tomatoes and chiles very softened, because we are going to blend it up.</li>
      <li>Drain it and then transfer everything to a blender, along with a cup or two of beef broth or water. Blend it up until smooth.</li>
      <li>Add the meat back to the large pot and pour the sauce over it. Pour 1 cup of broth in the blender and swish it back in forth (to pick up any extra sauce) and pour it into the pot. Bring it to a gentle simmer and then cover. Transfer the pot to the oven to braise for about 3 to 3 1/2 hours, until the meat shreds easily.</li>
      <li>Take out the meat and shredd it with forks</li>
      <li>Add some of the sauce to a bowl and add a little beef broth if it needs to be thinned out.</li>
      <li>Mince up some onion and cilantro and mix it in a small bowl with a few squeezes of lime and a pinch of salt.</li>
      <li>Add a spoonful of the cilantro and onion mixture to the consom√© and add a squeeze of lime.</li>
      <li>Dip a corn tortilla into the top of the sauce. This should be mostly fat. And add it to a non-stick skillet, set over medium-high heat.</li>
      <li>Flip over and then add a small handful of shredded meat and a handful of Oaxacan cheese. Shape it into a quesadilla/taco. And flip it over so it can get crispy and melty on the other side.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a baking sheet and place in a 200F oven while you work your way through the rest of the Birria tacos.</li>

  <h2>Tamales</h2>
  <img src="Tamales .jpeg" width="350">

  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>Tamales are one of the most authentic and original Mexican foods! They originated in MesoAmerica and spread to indigenous culturals in Mexico and Guatemala. Every Saturday on my dads side when my Grandpa and Grandma would come back from church they would bring Tamales from a mexican lady down the street with Champurraro. It was the best way to wake up especially when the delicous smell of both the Tamales and Champurrado hit your nose.</p>
  
  <h3>Ingrediants</h3>

    <li>Masa harina</li>
    <li>Broth</li>
    <li>Baking Powder</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Cumin</li>
    <li>Dried corn husks</li>
    <li>Lard</li>
  </ul>
 
  <h3>Steps</h3>

      <li>3 1/2-4 Cups of Masa</li>
      <li> about 3 1/2 Cup of what ever meat you want</li>
      <li>15oz of Beans 1 1/2 Mozzarella Cheese</li>
      <li> 2tbs of Broth of choice  </li>

      <li>Cover the mixing bowl with the dough inside so it doesnt dry out</li>
      <li>Lay a corn husk, glossy side up, on the counter with the wide end at the top. Scoop about ¬º cup of dough onto the top, center of the corn husk. Lay a piece of plastic wrap over the dough and use your hands to press and spread the masa into a thin layer. Keep the dough spread along the top half of the corn husk to allow plenty of room to fold the bottom husk up, when ready.</li>
      <li>Add your filling in the center of the dough</li>
      <li>Fold-in one long side of the husk over the filling. Fold in the other long side, overlapping the first (like folding a brochure). Fold the bottom of the husk up.</li>
      <li>Add water in a pot and use a steamer pot to then put the Tamales on top, steam for 1-2 hours depending on your quantity, once done then you have completed the Recipe</li>
